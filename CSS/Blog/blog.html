  <h2>This Is My First Article</h2>

  <p>We have a fantastic little sky! There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.</p>

  <p>Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.</p>

  <p>It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. There it is. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</p>

  <h2>This Is Another Article</h2>

  <p>Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? A little happy sunlight shining through there. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Little short strokes.</p>

  <p>Fluff that up. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Let all these things just sort of happen. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.</p>

  <p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>
